Various codes developed in research
======
* [Rossby wave activity](/files/LWA) --- diagnosing the large-scale wavy patterns and eddy mixing of quasi-conservative quantities in the atmosphere (used for potential vorticity, Z500, column water vapor, etc)

* [Space-time co-spectra of wave perturbations](/files/co-spectra) --- diagnosing the eddy characteristics of Rossby waves such as eddy momentum fluxes and heat fluxes

* Various modified versions of GFDL [Idealized Spectral Atmospheric Models](https://github.com/gchenpu/idealized) --- detailed documentations to be added
